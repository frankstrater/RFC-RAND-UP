Some notes on Victory Conditions and the Atlas:

- "in (year)" means you must satisfy all the requirements at the end of the specified year/turn. The
 following turn, the condition will pass or fail.

- "by (year)" means that you can satisfy the requirements any time before the end of the given year/turn.
 The condition should be passed the turn following completion of the requirements, otherwise it will fail
 after the given year.

- "control" basically means just that. You must control (have within your cultural borders) more area in
 the given region than the civilization of that region. There is no set number of cities. If the
 civilization is not active, one city should be enough to satisfy the condition. (I think. Please correct
 me if I'm wrong here.) (The Roman condition in the civilopedia is an exception and the necessary
 requirements are shown in the atlas.)
